cityProject
-----------
A project involving a pre-coded graph built via linked list where each node is a city in the USA and the weight of each edge is represented by some abstract distance between cities. Most of this code was written already - Our goal was to implement Dijkstra's algorithm in some form in order to identify the shortest path between two nodes provided via user input. An adjacency list was provided, which was a godsend, but this meant we had to learn how to navigate across the graph via the adjacency list that was already coded for us. This was a fun and interesting challenge.
